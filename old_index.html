            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am currently a Senior attending High Point University focusing my studies on the field of Computer Science. 
                I have developed several projects ranging from HTML + CSS websites to Python scripts for Discord bots. <br>
                My main interest is in the field of Cybersecurity and I am currently studying for the CompTIA+ certification. <br><br>
                Outside of the university, I take care of a beautiful daughter named Quinn who loves keeping me up through all hours of the night. <br><br>
                I also work in a restaurant as a cook and have over five years of experience in the kitchen. 
                Alongside my restaurant work, I have also worked at an elementary school assisting teachers in classrooms full of students.
